# - start VM
# - poll until ssh ready, or is there an rsync version of this?
# 	- someway to get an event from inside VM? Down serial port?
# 	- systemd service that runs once after sshd spins up and sends request down serial?
# - rsync files in sync mode over ssh
# - run pytest in watch mode
# - wait on rsync pid, qemu vm pid
# 	- does this handle signals correctly?
